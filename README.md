## Low-Fidelity Glove Prototype for Hypoesthesia Patients

This project involves the design and construction of a **low-fidelity glove prototype** for patients with hypoesthesia, aimed at providing an alerting system for critical temperature thresholds.

### Key Features:
- **User-Centered Design**: Conducted **QFD** (Quality Function Deployment), user requirement analysis, and **stakeholder interviews** to justify the design decisions.
- **Prototyping**: Developed a low-fidelity prototype tailored to hypoesthesia patients to enhance user safety and awareness.
- **Testing & Evaluation**: Formulated a comprehensive testing plan to conduct **reaction tests**, analyzing the glove's ability to alert users when critical temperature thresholds are met.

### How It Works:
1. The glove prototype was designed to incorporate tactile or visual alerts when the wearer is exposed to dangerously high or low temperatures.
2. The design process included extensive user feedback, ensuring the glove met the specific needs and constraints of hypoesthesia patients.
3. The **testing plan** focused on evaluating the effectiveness of the alerting system in preventing user injury from extreme temperatures.

### Tools & Methodologies:
- **QFD** for aligning user requirements and design specifications.
- **Engineering Analysis** for determining optimal alerting systems.
- **Prototyping** with a focus on usability and accessibility for patients with hypoesthesia.
